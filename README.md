# ðŸš€âœ¨ Data Science Learning Journey - PUC Campinas 

Welcome to my repository documenting my Data Science studies at PUC Campinas! 

### ðŸ“š Study Projects

#### Exploratory Data Analysis:
In this project, Exploratory Data Analysis is used to uncover patterns, trends, and potential outliers, providing valuable insights into the data's distribution and structure. It involves utilizing statistical and visual methods to gain a comprehensive overview, helping to inform subsequent steps in the data analysis pipeline and guiding the formulation of hypotheses for more in-depth investigation.

#### Data Visualization:
In this project, I leverage data visualization to analyze and interpret the dataset. Through a myriad of plotted graphs and charts, I aim to unravel complex relationships, patterns, and trends within the data. These visualizations serve as tools to communicate insights effectively, offering a clear and intuitive representation of the information.

#### Principal Component Analysis
In this project, I implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. PCA is employed as a dimensionality reduction technique, allowing me to capture the most significant variations in the data while reducing its complexity. Through the application of PCA, I aim to identify key patterns and relationships among variables, simplifying the dataset's representation without compromising crucial information.
